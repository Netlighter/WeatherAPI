# Weather API
---
_Parsing weather with [weatherstack](https://weatherstack.com/) in your android smartphone._
### You can:
  - Enter any city
  - Change access key to custom (if my expired >.<)
  - Push the button!!!
### How it works
You can find my access key in the code and use it safely until it expires. The program sends a GET-request to the site server with the `query` and `access key` fields. The response comes in JSON format and no information is changed or cut.
### Requirements
__Android 5.0 and above__
### Credits
Used Android Studio
Used GSON for parsing
Used free API from the [weatherstack](https://weatherstack.com/).
